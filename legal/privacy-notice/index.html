    <p>
      <a class="textlink" href="https://www.codeandco.com" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">code & co.</a> UG (haftungsbeschränkt), Torstr. 117, 10119 Berlin, Germany (“we”, “us” “our” and “code & co.”) is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. Please read this Privacy Policy to understand how we will collect, process and use (together “process”) your personal data in conjunction with the terms of use for the AR Face Fighter service, for which we are the data controller, whether utilised via the AR Face Fighter mobile app (the “App”), via the AR Face Fighter website available at www.facefighterapp.com (the “Website”, the Website and the App are together the “Service”). Below, we have indicated which parts of this Privacy Policy are applicable to the App and which parts are relevant for the Website. If you do not agree with the way we process personal data in accordance this Privacy Policy in whole or any part of it, then you should not use the Service.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">1. Information we may collect from you and how we use it</h4>

    <p>
      AR FaceFighter  is a fun game enabled by Apple's ARKit. When a user plays AR Face Fighter, the app compares a user's facial expression to the facial expression of an emoji as it falls from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen. If the two facial expressions match, the user receives points. The game is lost when the user has repeatedly failed to match an emoji's facial expression and the screen is filled with emoji.

      We process information that is required for the provision of the Service, for example, when you download the App, play a session of the game using ARKit and optionally share your high score (gif format). However, we don't ever store data, such as your facial expression, or share any data with a third party. The only data we store is your current high score and it is stored only locally on your iPhone and never shared with a 3rd party.

      You can read more on the technical implementation on the Apple Developer website at https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor.blendshapelocation.

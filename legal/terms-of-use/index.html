    <h4 class="mt-4">AR Face Fighter App & Website Terms of User</h4>
    <h4 class="mt-4">1. General</h4>
    <p>
      These terms of service (as updated from time to time, the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of the AR Face Fighter Service (as defined below) and any sound recordings, videos, information, text, graphics or other content materials uploaded, downloaded or appearing on the Service whether utilised via the AR Face Fighter mobile app (the “App”) or via the AR Face Fighter website available at facefighterapp.com (the “Website”), (the Website and the App together the “Service”). Please read these Terms carefully before downloading or using the Service. By accepting these Terms, you agree to be bound by them. If you do not understand the Terms, or do not accept any part of them, then you should not use the Service. The Service is provided by code & co.

    <h4 class="mt-4">2. The Service</h4>
    <p>
      2.1. AR Face Fighter is a fun AR game. It makes exclusive and unique use of the amazing capabilities of the iPhone X’s True Depth camera. Here’s how: The goal of the game is to replicate the beloved facial expressions of Emoji and by doing so quickly, collect points and climb the leaderboard. When a user begins playing, emojis fall from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen. Users try to mimic the facial expressions of every emoji they see falling from the top of the screen. The iPhone X’s True Depth camera recognizes a user’s facial expression and then compares the user’s facial expression to the emoji’s facial expression. If there’s a match – i.e. if a user successfully mirrored the emoji’s facial expression before it has reached the bottom of the screen – the emoji is removed from the screen and the user is awarded points. Then, the next emoji falls from the top of the screen.
